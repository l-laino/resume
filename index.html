            <p>
                Hey there! I'm Lucas, a last-minute hard worker and full-time curious nerd. My journey is a wild mix of
                tech, travel, and trial-and-error, fueled by iced lemon tea. I’m a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, with
                experience ranging from mechatronics and physiotherapy to game mastering and napkin folding. I’m
                currently channeling all this energy into becoming a full-fledged developer.

                <li>
                    <strong>Second Place at the Automation School Fair:</strong> Every year.<br>
                    Ok, hear me out—I consistently beat over 10 teams to snag second place, alright? Besides, silver suits me better anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Year 1: Biometric School Attendance System</strong><br>
                    A project designed to streamline classroom attendance by automating it through biometric fingerprint recognition. Teachers no longer had to waste time calling out names. The school appreciated it but ended up using it differently (not quite as planned).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Year 2: Stair-Climbing Wheelchair</strong><br>
                    Developed a prototype wheelchair capable of climbing stairs, reducing the cost by 70% compared to existing models. While the concept wasn’t new, our innovation was affordability and accessibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Year 3: Open-Source Wheelchair Project</strong><br>
                    Due to busy schedules (we had a mandatory internship that year), my group revamped the previous year's wheelchair project and shared the design specifications online. This made it freely available for anyone to build or improve upon—a proud moment for us in contributing to open innovation.

            <h2>Adventures</h2>
            <p>
                Born and raised in Brazil, I’ve always loved exploring. From chasing waterfalls to wandering Italy’s
                sun-soaked streets, my travels have taught me the importance of good food and great experiences.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Moved from Brazil to Italy before COVID struck. Took a brief adventure to London but returned to Italy
                    for the pasta and aperitivo culture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learned to navigate Venice’s airport using hand gestures and an address written on paper.
